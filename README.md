# datahack

It's a totally project produced in the context of DataHack (#datahack14) from TATA Communications.
It's a hack produce in Clojure, which I don't have quite experience but I felt that it was good enough to use in this hackathon which delivered a bunch large CSV files, to deal with them and produce data aggregations.

NOTE: The project doesn't contain the data files (CSV) due the terms and conditions of the hackthon which doen't allow to hold the data further than the hacathon's time

## Dependencies

Clojure environment (used version 1.6) under Java 1.7.0 (Concretely OpenJDK 64-Bit)
The project has been generated from [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) `app` template, therefore this repository contains everything to execute the project with [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/), with version 2.4.2 which I used it.

For the project dependencies (clojure and java libraries) check `project.clj` file
